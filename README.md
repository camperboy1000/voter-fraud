# Voter Fraud

Some scripting fun with ~~python~~ **oops, I re-wrote it in Rust**. This is a simple ~~python script~~ **Rust binary crate** that submits responses to a specified Google Form.

The name is in reference to Tenor Saxophone section leader elections where we commit "voter fraud" by submitting numerous amounts of joke responses to a specified "fraud" ballot. **I do not actually endorse commiting voter fraud.**
